/// The problem it solves: on a daisy chain (Mac -> display -> dock) macOS
/// publishes the USB devices as one flat forest per host controller with no
/// record of which downstream Thunderbolt device each one is physically plugged
/// into. The Thunderbolt fabric knows the chain exactly, and the USB tree knows
/// the hub cascade exactly, but nothing joins the two. Without a join, a dock's
/// Ethernet adapter renders five hub levels deep under the display the dock is
/// chained behind, which is where "12 rows, and you cannot tell what is plugged
/// into what" comes from.
///
/// No published technique exists for this on macOS, and `system_profiler
/// SPUSBDataType` returns nothing at all on the reference machine, so there is
/// no ground truth to copy. What follows is inference, and every step of it is
/// built to fail closed: **when the evidence does not single out one chain
/// device, the device stays unattributed and renders exactly where it does
/// today.** A wrong parent is worse than a flat list.
///
/// Evidence only. A device is grouped under a box when one of these places it,
/// and never otherwise:
///
/// 1. **Thunderbolt position.** The TB5 tunnel-hub map (route rule), the
///    USB-tunnel depth join and the PCIe Stage A and B joins.
/// 2. **USB2 pairing.** Each box's top USB2 hub, by position and a Container
///    ID only that box's structurally placed USB3 side carries.
/// 3. **The box's own identity device.** A USB device whose name equals the
///    box's model name exactly, or whose idVendor/idProduct equal the box's
///    DROM vendor/model numbers (the numbers win when the two disagree).
///
/// Identity evidence places only the identity device itself (`identityMark`
/// in `resolve`). It never passes the box on to a parent hub, and an identity
/// device that is itself a hub is not marked unless position evidence already
/// places that hub in the same box. Hubs, and everything under them, are
/// grouped by position evidence alone. A device whose own position and own
/// identity disagree is placed by neither and renders at port level.
///
/// Below a marked node, devices inherit its box down the forest, stopping at
/// the next mark. Anything nothing places stays unattributed and
/// `ConnectedDeviceTree` draws it in the port's separate "other devices"
/// section. Partial name matches and vendor IDs group nothing: in the corpus

        //    other on 0/0, and reproducing that promoted an unrelated hub.

        // internal "USB2 Hub" and "USB3 Gen2 Hub" personas, which carry no

        //    tunnel** (`usbTunnelSwitchUIDs`, derived by the caller from
        //    `ThunderboltTopology.tunnels(...).filter { $0.kind == .usb }`).
        //    Gated per DEPTH within that set, not per whole chain: a target
        //    depth only resolves when exactly one CONFIRMED-tunnelled switch
        //    sits there. This is deliberately narrower than "the whole chain
        //    is linear" would be, and the difference is real, not
        //    theoretical: the #493 reporter's own ground-truth machine has
        //    the CalDigit dock fan out to TWO depth-2 siblings, an OWC
        //    Express 1M2 (PCIe tunnel only, no USB tunnel of its own) and the
        //    LaCie 1big (tunnel bridge depth 4). A whole-chain gate, or a
        //    gate that counted every switch at a depth rather than only
        //    confirmed USB-tunnel ones, would refuse the LaCie's structural
        //    join purely because the OWC happens to share its depth, even
        //    though the OWC contributes zero conflicting bridge-depth
        //    evidence: nothing ever computes a target depth of 2 from the
        //    OWC, because it has no `AppleUSBXHCITR` controller to walk.
        //    Restricting to `usbTunnelSwitchUIDs` resolves LaCie's devices
        //    (and the Studio Display's, depth 3, chained behind it) while OWC
        //    is excluded from `depthCounts` entirely, which is the correct
        //    "cannot own anything" outcome for a device with no USB tunnel.
        //    Two GENUINELY USB-tunnelled switches sharing one depth is the
        //    actually-unproven case (zero corpus examples: 10 ports have
        //    more than one tunnelled controller, all 10 at distinct depths),
        //    and per-depth gating refuses exactly that, and only that.
        // 2. **The device's `tunnelRootName` belongs to THIS port.** When
        //    `expectedTunnelRootName` is known, an exact string match is
        //    required: a mismatch means this device's tunnel controller sits
        //    under a DIFFERENT physical port's `apciecN` root, a cross-port
        //    mixup, and it is refused outright regardless of how well the
        //    depth arithmetic lines up. When `expectedTunnelRootName` is
        //    `nil` (the caller could not derive it), this function falls
        //    back to an INTERNAL consistency check across every candidate in
        //    THIS resolve() call: if they disagree on `tunnelRootName`
        //    amongst themselves, that is itself evidence of a cross-port
        //    mixup upstream (devices from two different ports ended up in
        //    the same `forest`), and every one of them is refused; if they
        //    agree (or none report a root at all, e.g. replaying probe data
        //    that only captured up to the old terminator), the pass
        //    proceeds as before.
        // 3. **Precedence safety.** A device whose own exact-name match
        //    (`exact[id]`) or numeric identity (`numericIdentity(of:)`)
        //    resolves to a DIFFERENT chain device than the structural depth
