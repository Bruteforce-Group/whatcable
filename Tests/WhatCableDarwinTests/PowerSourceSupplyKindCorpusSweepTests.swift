/// Phase 2, item 2. Replays every `WinningPowerSourceOption` block in probe 17
/// through the real class-string parse.
///
/// The floor assertions matter more than the pass. A regex that matches
/// nothing returns a clean sweep, and this repo has been burned by exactly
/// that three times in one session. So the sweep asserts it FOUND blocks and
/// that it classified them, and a deliberate-break check proves it can go red.
///
/// WHAT THIS SWEEP CANNOT CHECK, and it is half the job. It validates block
/// FINDING, not Class READING. The corpus holds exactly one distinct `Class`
/// value across every block, so a reader that ignored the probe text
/// entirely and returned the expected string as a constant would pass this
/// sweep completely clean. That is inherent in the data, not a gap someone
/// forgot to close, and no amount of extra corpus work fixes it: there is no
/// second value in the corpus to tell a real parse from a hardcoded one.
/// Shown by PR #599's review gate.
///
/// The other half is covered by the companion unit test in this file,
/// ``failsClosedOnUnknownClass``, which feeds the classifier strings the
/// corpus does not contain and pins that they do NOT reach `.fixed`. That is
/// what proves the classifier is a function of its input rather than a
/// constant. Do not read a green sweep on its own as evidence the parse is
/// right; the two tests are only meaningful together.
